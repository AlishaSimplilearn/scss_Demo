    <h1>The Great Gatsby</h1>
    <p>The Great Gatsby is a 2013 historical romantic drama film based on the 1925 novel of the same name by F. Scott Fitzgerald. The film was co-written and directed by Baz Luhrmann and stars an ensemble cast consisting of Leonardo DiCaprio, Tobey Maguire, Carey Mulligan, Joel Edgerton, Isla Fisher, Jason Clarke, and Elizabeth Debicki.[4] Jay-Z served as executive producer. Filming took place from September to December 2011 in Australia, with a $105 million net production budget. The film follows the life and times of millionaire Jay Gatsby (DiCaprio) and his neighbor Nick Carraway (Maguire), who recounts his encounter with Gatsby at the height of the Roaring Twenties on Long Island in New York.

        A polarizing film among critics, The Great Gatsby received both praise and criticism for its visual style, direction, screenplay, performances, soundtrack, and its interpretation of the source material. Audiences responded more positively,[5] and Fitzgerald's granddaughter praised the film, stating "Scott would have been proud."[6] As of 2023, it is Luhrmann's highest-grossing film, grossing over $353 million worldwide.[7] At the 86th Academy Awards, the film won in both of its nominated categories: Best Production Design and Best Costume Design.</p>
