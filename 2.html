    <h1>Bird Neighbors</h1>
    <p>After discussing the scientific classification of birds by families, <br>Blanchan lists 19 "habitats" where birds can be found (such as "birds seen<br> near the edges of woods" and "birds found near salt water"),<br> and groups the birds themselves by size and color.The 52 color illustrations <br>were produced by photographing stuffed birds in front of appropriate backgrounds,<br> since cameras of the time could not take good photographs of living birds.<br> The published photographs were also limited by the color printing technologies of the time,<br> and some of the darker birds have been described as looking like <br>"they had been dipped in shoe polish</p>
