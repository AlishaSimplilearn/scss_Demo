    <h1>The Bird Name</h1>
    <p>The Bird Name Book is an alphabetical reference book on the<br> origins and meanings of common group bird names, from “accentor” to “zeledonia.” <br>A cornucopia of engaging facts and anecdotes, this superbly researched <br>compendium presents a wealth of incisive entries alongside stunning photos <br>by the author and beautiful historic prints and watercolors. <br>Myers provides brief biographies of prominent figures in ornithology—such as<br> John Gould, John Latham, Alfred Newton, and Robert Ridgway—and goes on to describe <br>the etymological history of every common group bird name found in standardized English.<br> She interweaves the stories behind the names with quotes from publications dating<br> back to the 1400s, illuminating the shared evolution of language and our<br> relationships with birds, and rooting the names in the history of ornithological discovery.</p>
